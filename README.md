# Yes, there is a lot of headphones references in this project. In fact, I used headphones as a base, but also code from SickBeard and CouchPotato to learn how to write a python program.
# It's a goal to eliminate all references to these other projects, but I need to create a working program first. Taking babysteps ;)

# LazyLibrarian is a program to follow authors and grab metadata for all your digital reading needs.
